### **Project Title: Improving Price Prediction Accuracy for Magnificent Seven Stocks Utilizing Cross-Stock Historical Data**

### **Participant Name: Kunasekaran Nirmalkanna**


    1. Introduction

This project explores improving stock price prediction accuracy for the "Magnificent Seven" stocks by incorporating historical data from other stocks into traditional AR(1) models. The study finds that including multiple lags of cross-stock prices enhances prediction accuracy in some instances.

    2. Selection of dataset

I will obtain the dataset from the Yahoo Finance API, which provides free access to historical stock price data for a wide range of publicly traded companies. This dataset offers comprehensive and reliable historical data for the selected stocks, allowing for in-depth analysis and modelling.

    3. Plan for analysis

The analysis I intend to perform on the dataset involves several key steps to achieve the goals of my project:
    A) Data Preprocessing: I will start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in the data format. 
    B) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Next, I will conduct EDA to gain insights into the historical trends and patterns of the selected stocks. This will involve visualizing the stock price movements over time, identifying correlations between the stocks, and exploring the impact of external factors.
    C) Model Development: Using machine learning algorithms, I will develop predictive models to forecast the future trends of the selected stocks. 
    D) Model Evaluation:  This step will assess the models' ability to accurately forecast stock price movements and identify any areas for improvement.
    E) Visualization and Interpretation: This will visualize the model predictions and insights generated from the analysis to communicate the findings effectively. 
To perform this analysis, I will primarily use software tools and libraries commonly used in data science and machine learning, including:
    • Python programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modelling.
    • Jupyter Lab for interactive development and documentation of the analysis process.
    • Pandas and NumPy libraries for data preprocessing and manipulation.
    • Scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries to implement machine learning algorithms and model development.
    • Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization and plotting.
