Magnificent Seven Stocks Trend Analysis

    1. Introduction

My project will focus on conducting a comprehensive analysis of the trends in seven selected stocks (Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta and Tesla), which are referred to as the "Magnificent Seven Stocks." The analysis involves exploring historical stock price data, developing predictive models to forecast future trends, and evaluating the performance of these models.
The significance of this analysis lies in its practical applications in the financial markets. By understanding the historical trends of these seven stocks and developing accurate predictive models, investors and traders can make more informed decisions regarding their investments. I was inspired to choose this topic due to my interest in both data science and finance. 

    2. Selection of dataset

I will obtain the dataset from the Yahoo Finance API, which provides free access to historical stock price data for a wide range of publicly traded companies. This dataset offers comprehensive and reliable historical data for the selected stocks, allowing for in-depth analysis and modelling.

    3. Plan for analysis

The analysis I intend to perform on the dataset involves several key steps to achieve the goals of my project:
    A) Data Preprocessing: I will start by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, and ensuring consistency in the data format. 
    B) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Next, I will conduct EDA to gain insights into the historical trends and patterns of the selected stocks. This will involve visualizing the stock price movements over time, identifying correlations between the stocks, and exploring the impact of external factors.
    C) Model Development: Using machine learning algorithms, I will develop predictive models to forecast the future trends of the selected stocks. 
    D) Model Evaluation:  This step will assess the models' ability to accurately forecast stock price movements and identify any areas for improvement.
    E) Visualization and Interpretation: This will visualize the model predictions and insights generated from the analysis to communicate the findings effectively. 
To perform this analysis, I will primarily use software tools and libraries commonly used in data science and machine learning, including:
    • Python programming language for data manipulation, analysis, and modelling.
    • Jupyter Lab for interactive development and documentation of the analysis process.
    • Pandas and NumPy libraries for data preprocessing and manipulation.
    • Scikit-learn and TensorFlow libraries to implement machine learning algorithms and model development.
    • Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for data visualization and plotting.
